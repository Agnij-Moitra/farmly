As the free tier of keroku has low ram, at times the website might crash. But it shoould work after two - three atempts.
### Vision:
It was rightly said by Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji, “Jai Jawan Jai Kisan”. Our vision is to add value to the lives of millions of farmers by our agricultural services.
### Problem:
It was rightly said by Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji, “Jai Jawan Jai Kisan”. Our vision is to add value to the lives of millions of farmers by our agricultural services. Without agriculture no nation can prosper. On one hand people are starving to death, and on the other famers need to abandon crops for not getting the right price. Further, India being an agricultural nation it is important for the farmers to prosper and thrive for the nation’s future. Further, because of many preventable crop diseases, each year tens of thousands of plants die.
### Solution:
Farmly, uses advanced AI and machine learning to recommend the best crops to grow for farmers. And also estimate the amounts of Nitrogen, Phosphorus and to grow that grow. Further using Open CV it also identifies crop diseases and prescribes its treatment.
### Implementation:
Farmly, uses advanced AI and machine learning to recommend the best crops to grow for farmers. And also estimate the amounts of Nitrogen, Phosphorus and to grow that grow.Using Feature Engineering, we concluded that temperature, humidity, PH level of soil and rainfall correlates to the crop grown. Thus we used this feature set to train our machine learning model using the Random Forest Ensemble, at the end it has an accuracy of 95% ± 4%. Further it uses Open CV’s template matching in order to identify the disease.
